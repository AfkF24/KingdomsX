# Please refer to Turrets folder if you want to configure each turret.

# If you don't want to use turrets, set this to false. It'll increase the performance drastically.
# But you still need to remove the option from the nexus GUI so people can't buy any.
# Needs a restart to work.

# Amount of turrets limited per land/chunk.
# Set to 0 for no limit.

# Remove turrets when lands are unclaimed automatically? This will simply break the turret naturally as if it was broken by a player.

# Seconds before turrets can shoot players after they've been teleported.

# WARNING: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING THIS OPTION:
# By changing this option you're changing how often turrets perform checks and activate.
# By default, it's every 1 tick. Meaning every 1 second, 20 checks are performed.
# If you change it to 2 ticks for instance, all the turrets will be affected.
# Meaning if the turret's cooldown was "10" ticks now it's "10 * 2 = 20" ticks.
# For example, if you set this to 20, all turrets are limited to shoot every second, no matter how long the cooldown is.
# Every single number of this option matters up to 100 ticks for performance. After 100 ticks the performance is just not noticable anymore,
# unless you have an unusual high number of turrets.
# Requires a restart to update.

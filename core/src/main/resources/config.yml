  # When using Kingdoms as an international plugin, updating GUI files will get troublesome

  # When you decide to change the GUI layout for any GUI, you'd have to go to the
  # GUI config of all languages to update the layout as well. To make this simpler,
  # enabling this will allow you to synchronize non-translatable options across all
  # GUIs in other languages when they're changed.
  # You can also write "-NOSYNC" at the beginning of a comment of a YAML option to
  # exclude that option from being synchronized. This is used for advanced translatable
  # properties (such as commands or yaml functions)

# Place your translated file in the plugin's folder.
# The file's name should be the same as the option below without the .yml file extension.
# Some of these language files are outdated.
# GUIs also have their own language file which can be found in the "guis" folder.
# Standard way of naming this is to follow IETF language tags.
# from IETF (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)
# All the language files are made by the community, they're not guaranteed to be 100% accurate and complete.
# For technical info see: https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/   and   https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#page-5
# Please refer to https://github.com/CryptoMorin/KingdomsX/wiki/Config#language-file if you want to translate the plugin.
# If you translated the plugin you can contact me, and I'll add it to the plugin.
# If you translated a language that wasn't supported in the plugin before, In order for the international
# function of the plugin to work, you actually need to submit your translation for
# it to be directly added to the plugin, otherwise players wouldn't be able to use your translation.

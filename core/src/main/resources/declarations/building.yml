# Maximum level this building can be upgraded to.

# The amount of time for a specific type of building to be finished.

  # max() is used here just in case the duration factor is negative.
  # opening: 'max(0, [1min] + [<build-duration-factor>])'
  opening: '[10secs]'
  #  upgrading: 'max(0, ([1min] + [<build-duration-factor>]) * level)'
  upgrading: '[10 seconds]'
  repairing: '[1sec] * (building_max_durability - building_durability)'
  demolishing: 'building_region_blocks * [50ms]'

# The durability of a building (used for things like siege cannons)
durability: '<durability-factor> * level'

repair:
  # Resource points needed for a full repair.
  cost: '(building_max_durability - building_durability) / 2'

  # When turret durability is not max but isn't 0 either, you
  # can use these items to repair it instantly.
  # Players need to drop the item near the turret they want to fix.

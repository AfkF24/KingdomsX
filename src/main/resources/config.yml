  # If you set this to false, you can still check for updates using /k updates command.

  # Should the plugin automatically download updates to the specified path?
  # Please also read the path option if you want to change this option.

  # Now you might be asking, why would you need to use the current version?
  # The "update" folder in "plugins" folder (the folder name can be changed in bukkit.yml) is used to
  # automatically replace any JARs in that folder with the JARs in "plugins" folder that have the same name.
  # Now, because the plugin JAR name format is "name-version", this name must be
  # the same as the plugin name in the "plugins" folder.
  # So if you want your server to automatically update the plugin for you after downloading it,
  # you have to use the current version. The only bad thing is, you'll confuse the versions of course.

# The language file name.
# Place your translated file in the plugin's folder.

# Standard way of naming this is to follow IETF language tags.

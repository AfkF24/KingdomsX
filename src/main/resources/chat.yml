# The chat priority that kingdom handles. Not that changing this will not disable the chat. You need to use other options.
# This is used when you're using another plugin that manages chat spams and other restrictions. You might want to increase the priorty in these cases.
# This option requires a restart to work.
# In Bukkit logic, lower priorities mean executed before the higher priorities.
# So for example, if a plugin like Essentials or LiteBans use NORMAL priority to format chat or mute players,
# you'd have to choose "HIGH" priority so the plugin can know chat has been cancelled by these plugins.
# Normally you shouldn't and wouldn't need to use the MONITOR priority, but if a plugin higher priorities for
# any reason (which they shouldn't) you can use it.
# We will use the HIGHEST priority here just in case.
# LOWEST, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, HIGHEST, MONITOR
priority: HIGHEST

# Should kingdoms plugin completely cancel the chat event?
# This is useful customize some plugins such as DiscordSRV, but
# it can also break other plugins like the ones that mute players.
# In these cases, you usually have to set the priority to MONITOR
# (even tho it's not recommended) and it might work.
